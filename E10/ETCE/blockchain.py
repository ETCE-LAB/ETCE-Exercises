        1. Validate the `block.previous_block_hash` and the
        transactions in the block, by checking whether the inputs
        contain enough tokens for the transactions, and also check the
        previous block hash and block number. For simplicity, you can
        assume that no two transactions in a block depend on each
        other, and transactions only depend on those from previous
        blocks

        2. Create a copy of self.addresses dictionary with updated
        token amounts, adding new addresses where necessary like in
        __init__, and additionally decreasing the token amount from
        the inputs.

        3. Return the boolean result of step 1, as well as a
        dictionary representing the new addresses.

        NOTE: the addresses dictionary is only used for easy
        validation of transactions. In a real scenario, every node in
        the blockchain computes this internally while doing the
        validation. When a new block is propagated/ blockchain is sent
        to other nodes, only the list of blocks is required.
        
        You can store whatever information you like in the addresses
        dict. A suggestion is to also store the tx_hash, or you could
        just store the last transaction with output to that address
        
        Important: The realtest autograding driver will validate any
        transactions (return True for any argument), since we already
        implemented transaction validation in the last exercise.

        We have already put a correct solution to this function,
        including the updates to the transactions here, however, this
        function will not be relevant for grading.
